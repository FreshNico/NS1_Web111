            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <h2> Biography</h2>
            <h4>
                Hello, my name is Nicolas Sandoval and welcome to my About Me page. I am currently a junior
                student at California State University, Los Angeles.<br> I am the youngest of 4 in family of 6.
                I am 22 years old, Mexican American, and a first-generation college student. My parents and
                siblings<br>
                came to
                the U.S in the 90â€™s. I was the first person in my family to be born in the U.S so I have lived a life
                completely different than they have.<br> I grew up in South Central and I learned how it is to struggle
                and
                start from the ground up. I lived in a marginalized community where there<br> was a lot of gun violence
                and
                gangs. I joined sports and clubs such as track, soccer, cross country and math clubs in middle school
                and<br>
                high school in order to separate myself from all of this. Despite being in a very toxic and negative
                environment, I graduated high school<br> and enrolled into a university. I am grateful to those who have
                helped
                me along the way.
                <br>
                <br>

                I entered higher education in order to pursue a major in Computer Science. Technology is something I
                immediately knew was going to be big.<br> The thought of being involved in these types of advancements
                in
                our
                society made it obvious that this is what I wanted to do. I was always a<br> big gamer and music savvy
                person.
                This led to me also creating music and poetry as I grew up. I thought of it as a way to channel my life
                and<br>
                experiences so that others could relate or become knowledgeable about the lives that people like me
                live.

                <br>
                <br>
                Now, I want to focus on the life ahead of me and the things I can do to help people. I hope to further
                my
                skills and knowledge in my field in order<br> to create solutions to problems that underrepresented
                communities,
                such as mine, go through. At college, I met many great friends and professors<br> that have helped me
                hone
                my
                skills in all areas of work ethic, from critical soft skills to computer programming. These skills I
                carry
                with me everywhere<br> I go and practice them religiously in order to put into practice what I was
                taught
                and to
                learn from others.
                <br>
                <br>

                Thank you for visiting my page and reading about my life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Best Regards
